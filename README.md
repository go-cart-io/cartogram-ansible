# go-cart.io deployment using Ansible

## Prerequisites
Ansible can only be run on UNIX-like machine with Python installed (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, macOS). If you have a Windows environment, please install [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and execute the commands in the WSL 2 shell. The respository should already be cloned and commands will be executed in the repository directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/Wind1337/cartogram-ansible/
cd cartogram-ansible
```

### Install Ansible
You should have Python 3 installed. We will use venv to install and execute Ansible

#### venv method
Check the python version:\
```python -V```

Example Output:
```
Python 3.10.6
         ^^
         minor version 10
```

You might need to install the python venv package on **Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based distros**:\
(replace 'y' with the Python 3 minor version installed on your OS from the previous output)\
```apt install python3.y-venv```

For Python 3.12:\
```apt install python3.12-venv```

Create and activate venv:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Ansible:\
```pip install ansible```

Confirm that Ansible has been installed correctly:\
```ansible --version```

If you wish to upgrade the installed Ansible version in the future, run:\
```pip install --upgrade --user ansible```

### Installing pre-requisite packages/collections
To install the Ansible collections required:\
```ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml```

The digitalocean Ansible collection requires additional Python libraries to run (documented [here](https://github.com/digitalocean/ansible-collection?tab=readme-ov-file#external-requirements)). You might need to check the documentation if the requirements have been updated and update ```requirements.txt``` accordingly.

To install the Python libraries required:\
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Deploying go-cart.io

### Configure Ansible variables in vars.yml

Next, we will set up other variables that will be used to configure the go-cart.io application.

Copy vars.yml.dist to vars.yml, like so:

    cp playbooks/inventories/vars.yml.dist playbooks/inventories/vars.yml

Modify ```playbooks/inventories/vars.yml``` with the following details:
| Variable | Example Value | Remarks |
| -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| do_token | ```"dop_v1_abc1234sdfg"``` | Cloud Services API token (Obtained from Digital Ocean) |
| domain_name | ```"go-cart.io"``` | Domain name used for the web server |
| smtp_host | ```"smtp.mailgun.org"``` | SMTP server host name (Obtained from MailGun) |
| smtp_port | ```587``` | SMTP server port (Obtained from MailGun) |
| smtp_auth_required | ```"TRUE"```| Set to true when we require a username and password to send emails via MailGun |
| smtp_user | ```"contactform@mg.go-cart.io"``` | Obtained from MailGun |
| smtp_password | | Obtained from MailGun. If you are able to retrieve the existing password, a password reset can be avoided. |
| smtp_from_email | ```"contactform@mg.go-cart.io"``` | Email sender displayed on email sent from MailGun |
| smtp_destination | ```"support@go-cart.io"``` | Recipient of the email sent from MailGun |
| postgres_password | ```"password"``` | Password for the PostgreSQL Database. As a new PostgreSQL database is installed, this password is defined by the user executing this script |
| github_username | ```"mgastner"``` | GitHub username (not organization name) of user with write access to relevant go-cart repositories (cartogram-docker, cartogram-web, cartogram-cpp). |

More is explained about the Digital Ocean variables in the next step.

**Obtaining MailGun details**
![mailgun_1](./images/mailgun_1.png)
![mailgun_2](./images/mailgun_2.png)

You will be able to copy the new mailgun password upon password reset at Step 6.

**Obtaining Digital Ocean Token**

Login to your DigitalOcean Account and go to the "API" page

![API Sidebar](./images/api_sidebar.png)

Click on "Generate New Token"

![Generate New Token](./images/generate_token.png)

Give the token a memorable name and choose a token expriation duration. You may set the token to never expire if you wish to.\
Grant the token "Full Access" and generate the token.

![Token Configuration](./images/token_scope.png)

The token will now be displayed on screen.

### Configure Ansible variables in vars.yml

In the same file, we will need to define the Droplet specifications.

We can use the following website to determine the technical jargon of the DigitalOcean API to define the droplet specifications: https://slugs.do-api.dev/

| Website Term | Ansible Variable Value (playbooks/digitalocean.yml) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Regions | droplet_region |
| Droplet Sizes | droplet_size |
| Distro Images | droplet_image |

Below are a few examples of values and what it corresponds to:

**Regions**
| Value | Meaning   |
| ----- | --------- |
| sgp1  | Singapore, Datacenter 1 |
| sfo3  | San Francisco, Datacenter 3 |

**Droplet Sizes (Droplet hardware specifications)**
| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| s-2vcpu-4gb | Shared Regular CPU, 2 cores, 4GB RAM |
| s-4vcpu-8gb | Shared Regular CPU, 4 cores, 8GB RAM |
| s-2vcpu-4gb-120gb-intel | Shared Premium Intel CPU, 2 cores, 4GB RAM |
| s-4vcpu-8gb-amd | Shared Premium AMD CPU, 4 cores, 8GB RAM |

**Distro Images**
| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| ubuntu-24-04-x64 | Ubuntu 24.04 x64 |
| debian-12-x64 | Debian 12 x64 |

Now that we have determined how to spec our DigitalOcean droplet, we can set the following vars in ```playbooks/digitalocean.yml```
| Variable | Recommended Value | Remarks |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| droplet_size | ```s-2vcpu-4gb ```| |
| droplet_image | ```ubuntu-24-04-x64``` | Or whatever is the latest Ubuntu LTS |
| droplet_region | ```sgp1``` | |
| droplet_name | ```<any suitable name>``` | |

This script will generate and save a SSH keypair for accessing the DigitalOcean droplet. You can change where the key is saved with the following vars:
- local_ssh_pub_key_path
- local_ssh_private_key_path

Alternatively if you wish to use your own existing SSH keypair, you can point these 2 variables to the location of your SSH public and private key. You need to do this in case you plan to use a keypair that already exists under your Digital Ocean project.

### Executing Ansible Playbook

With everything configured, we can now execute the deployment with\
```ansible-playbook playbooks/digitalocean.yml```

The execution will pause at certain stages where manual intervention is required.

1. You will need to manually update the domain DNS records with the newly deployed DigitalOcean droplet's IP Address. The message in the console will show ```Please update domain DNS records with IP Address:```. Press the 'Enter' key to continue execution once this is done.
2. You will need to generate a new GitHub personal access token to setup automated deployment. Paste the token into the terminal when prompted.

**Generating GitHub personal access token**
1. Go to the settings of your GitHub Account
![github_1](./images/github_1.png)
![github_2](./images/github_2.png)
2. Scroll down and click on "Developer Settings"
![github_3](./images/github_3.png)
3. Click on "Personal access tokens" > "Tokens (classic)" > "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
![github_4](./images/github_4.png)
4. Give the token a memorable name. As this token will be used only for 1 time, the token can be set to expire any time you like. Grant the token the full "repo" access scope
![github_5](./images/github_5.png)
5. Scroll down and click on "Generate token"
![github_6](./images/github_6.png)
6. The token will be displayed on screen. Copy the token.
